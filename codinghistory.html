    <h2>Melissa's Coding History</h2>
    <p>Although I just started my coding journey, I feel like I’ve always been on this path. I programmed balloons going across the screen on an old Apple computer in the first grade. My mom soon after got a Commodore 64 that we hooked up to a black and white television. After that, we moved on to a Tandy from RadioShack. In elementary school, we were learning math skills on the Apple II. In college, I became obsessed with MUD (multiplayer real-time virtual world) text games.</p>
    <p>It wasn’t until after college that I discovered graphic design. I taught myself Photoshop first, then Quark Xpress. I started working at a grocery distributor where I designed cheesy weekly ads like, “Summer Savings Spectacular.” I started out on ads, then was promoted to a new position of taking photos and maintaining the image library.</p>
    <p>My next position was as a Store Manager and I was glad to get back to working with customers. The company had just a landing page for a website, so I took on the task by learning HTML and Dreamweaver. I spoke with all the departments and got feedback from every employee before starting the design process, which lead to also learning how to deploy a website. After tackling a task, I was thirsty for more, so I was promoted twice wherever I was needed. I traveled and eventually became a Regional Store Director.</p>
    <p>I moved to New York and started working at a commercial real estate company where I’ve learned mapping and worked on a few simple web projects.</p>

    <p>I next took a 16 week class at New York Code & Design Academy. Wed Development 100 consisted of 8 weeks of brushing up on my skills in HTMl, CSS and Javascript with the last 8 weeks focusing on Ruby on Rails. I love Ruby on Rails and have 3 different projects that I’m working on right now.</p>
